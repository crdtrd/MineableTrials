# MineableTrials
## Summary
A server side fabric mod that lets the player harvest and reuse vaults and trial spawners.
## Features
- Vaults (both normal and ominous) and trial spawners are harvestable with iron level or higher pickaxes with silk touch.
- Vaults have a 1-hour cooldown per player after opening and a 1-hour cooldown for all players when placed.
- Player placed trial spawners properly spawn ominous loot when ominous. 
- Player placed trial spawners are empty, and I have left it up to the mod user to decide how they want to fill them (remember that spawn eggs fill spawners).
